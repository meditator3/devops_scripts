these scripts are mostly bash from exercises in class, and some in python.
*kill-process is killing a process via its port(python)
*reverse-file is reversing the content of each line in a file, usage ./reverse-file <text file> -l <x number of lines to reverse> (python)
*updator is just updates for apt (bash)
to help with reverse file test, can use user-into-file (python also), which recieves name of text file, and lines to be inserted.
