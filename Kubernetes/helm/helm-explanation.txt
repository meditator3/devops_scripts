helm needs first of all image and port and name of app.
like a deployment.

if you work on k8s-images are different???
so to create helm chart you need first and foremost the image

-process---

mkdir  k8s-demo

helm create web-server 

-- we got folder with

charts, templates
chart.yaml 
values.yaml
.helmignore

under charts usually nothing

under templates:

ingress.yaml
service.yaml
deployment.yaml
hpa.yaml  (horizontal pod autoscaler)
serviceaccount.yaml


ingress.yaml
-----
there are different version of api if it is under v19.  there are conditions for each version of k8s we use, we get different api version to it. sometimes we wont get ingressClassName if its earlier than v18

we don't touch anything here.


-0-----
we don't have STS-statefulset, so we have to prepare it ourselves.

example of added values:

service.yaml
----
spec:
  protocol: {{ .Values.service.protocol }} # in the template we decide if its UDP or TCP
  name: {{ .Values.service.name }} # instead of name in the service
