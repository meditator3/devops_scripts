+ we need metallb too to interface with ingress istio

more detail:
Istio provides TLS shakes which is encrypted data transfers between microservices/apps/containers/servers, instead of making changes to the app itself.

how metallb interfaces with istio?
MetalLB is used here in order to provide an IP address for the Istio IngressGateway service of LoadBalancer type thus emulating a cloud deployment. This is used to avoid NodePort implementations with Istio as they are not to be used due to Istio design.
 

installation:
install metalLB:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.6/manifests/namespace.yaml
download from here deplyment and configmap:

https://github.com/lisenet/kubernetes-homelab/tree/master/kubernetes/metallb

apply.


if you want secret:
kubectl create secret generic -n metallb-system memberlist --from-literal=secretkey="$(openssl rand -base64 128)"

check all is working:
kubectl get all -n metallb-system
