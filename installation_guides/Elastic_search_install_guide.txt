short explanation:
elastic is a company that can raise on cloud clusters for logging.
you need cluster for logging, and LB the logs.
or deploy it on your cloud env. 
all costs money. unless we don't use 


https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana-elastic-stack-on-ubuntu-22-04
install nginx  (before doing passwords!)
ignore reverse proxy stage, because then it costs money to login for kibana

check whats the port for kibana, use sudo apt instal net-tools, and netstat -tanup

change /etc/kibana (vi) remove comments on #port and #localhost=0.0.0.0

edit inbound rules for the sec.group for http

user: kibanaadmin password: (simple one)
encrypted password: kibanaadmin:$apr1$u5paoH51$cJWmAgtWXiweJiTvTWtS40


BUT, we still did it. to look at it.
install nginx

create new site vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/kibana
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/kibana /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/kibana

in the server_name -
(to allow access to all?? check in AI)
also delete default in 
/etc/nginx/site-enabled 
which routes default always, instead of kibana which we defined it earlier.

you can access kibana WITHOUT username/password with port 5601


installing logstash:
usually in a company you would install it on a different server

we changed machine size. shutting it down, chose t2.xlarge for 4 cpu
becuase top was showing lots of load

installing filebeat-
filebeat is like an agent that passes everything from logstash to kibana.

XXXXXX not working stuck on localhost:5044 not working...???
