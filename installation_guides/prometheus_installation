LB is wrong, in records, so we need to create new NLB
and setup helm chart for ingress again using:
https://amod-kadam.medium.com/setting-up-nginx-ingress-controller-with-eks-f27390bcf804

and also get helm chart for prometheus, via :

https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts


and change values:
he searched via ingress, and chose to change:
line 376 ingress : true
line 381 ingressclassname : nginx
hosts:
 -alertmanager.arieldevops.tech

line 962 ingress: true
967 remove comment, for ingressclassname
hosts:
 - grafana.arieldevops.tech

same thing for prometheus hosts and ingresss/ingress classname


only with grafan: paste address
user:admin
psw: promoperator





after putting records for alert_manager, grafana and prometheus in route53




create ns montoring in kubectl

to install the "monster" prometheus via helm after updated values
helm install kube-prom -n monitoring -f ariel-values promethius-community/kube-prometheus-stack

if installation not working use:
helm ls -n monitoring

and if there's helm in that ns, delete-
helm delete kube-prom -n monitoring

and start again with the install
or update, with same command like install with the values file
if install works:
paste dns names of grafana or alertmanager, and remember it doesn't save the meterics, you need to export to json, or other
to save stats.
you need to change the values to create a new PVC claim to setup the chart to save the stats/metrics.

if you want to get KPI(meter for getting monitors for value of company!)
you ask for developers for service witha port to give to prometheus, and for the application of 
the company. and prometheus builds the meterics, and bring a new dashboard with all the new data and meterics of 
what prometheus collected
